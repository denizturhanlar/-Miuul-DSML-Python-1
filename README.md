Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.


# Python Exercises Tasks
## TASK 1: Examine the types of data structures.
x = 8
y = 3.2
z = 8j + 18
a = "Hello World"
b = True
c = 23 < 22
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, "String", 3.2, False]
d = {"Name": "Jake", "Age": [27, 56], "Adress": "Downtown"}
t = ("Machine Learning", "Data Science")
s = {"Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Science", "Python"}

# TASK 2: Convert all letters of the given string expression to uppercase. Put space instead of commas and periods, separate them word by word.
text = "The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight."

- TASK 3: Do the following tasks for the given list.
lst = ["D", "A", "T", "A", "S", "C", "I", "E", "N", "C", "E"]
-Step 1: Look at the number of elements of the given list.
-Step 2: Call the elements at index zero and ten.
-Step 3: Create a list ["D","A","T","A"] from the given list.
-Step 4: Delete the element in the eighth index.
-Step 5: Add a new element.
-Step 6: Re-add element "N" to the eighth index.

-  TASK 4: Apply the following steps to the given dictionary structure.
dict = {'Christian': ["America", 18], 'Daisy': ["England", 12], 'Antonio': ["Spain", 22], 'Dante': ["Italy", 25]}

-Step 1: Access the key values.
-Step 2: Access the values.
-Step 3: Update the value 12 of the Daisy key to 13.
-Step 4: Add a new value whose key value is Ahmet value [Turkey,24].

- TASK 5: Write a function that takes a list as an argument, assigns the odd and even numbers in the list to separate lists, and returns these lists.
l = [2, 13, 18, 93, 22]

- TASK 6: In the list given below are the names of the students who won degrees in engineering and medicine faculties.
While the first three students represent the success order of the engineering faculty, the last three students belong to the medical faculty student rank, respectively.
Print the student's degrees specific to the faculty using Enumarate.
students = ["Ali", "Veli", "AyÅŸe", "Talat", "Zeynep", "Ece"]

- TASK 7: 3 lists are given below. In the lists, there is a course code, credit and quota information, respectively. Print course information using zip.
lesson_codes = ["CMP1005", "PSY1001", "HUK1005", "SEN2204"] credits = [3, 4, 2, 4] quota = [30, 75, 150, 25]

- TASK 8: Below are 2 sets.
You are asked to define the function that will print the difference of the 2nd set from the 1st set, if the 1st set includes the 2nd set, if it does not cover the common elements
set_1 = set(["data", "python"]) set_2 = set(["data", "function", "qcut", "lambda", "python", "miuul"])
